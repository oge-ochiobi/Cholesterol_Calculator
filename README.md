Cholesterol classification logic


 How It Works
User inputs:
-  Total Cholesterol
-  HDL (Good cholesterol)
-  LDL (Bad cholesterol)


Tool evaluates results using standard guidelines:
-  Desirable Total Cholesterol: < 200 mg/dL
-  Borderline: 200–239 mg/dL
-  High: ≥ 240 mg/dL
Includes optional Triglyceride-based logic (if added)


 Features
- Input-based health logic
- Risk classification and feedback
- Expandable to full lipid panel



 What I Learned:
This project helped me dive deeper into health metrics and interpret medical logic through code. It was also a great opportunity to explore user input design and feedback systems in Python.
